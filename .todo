Prompt: Digital Clock Component with User-Selectable Styles

You are a frontend engineer building a reusable Digital Clock component for a modern dashboard application.

Goal
Build a configurable digital clock component that supports multiple user-selectable visual styles and can be embedded anywhere in the dashboard.

Core Requirements

Displays current time in real-time (HH:MM:SS)

Supports 12h and 24h formats

Time updates every second using an efficient timer

Uses the client’s local timezone by default

Styling Variants (user-selectable)
Implement at least the following digital styles:

Classic Digital (7-segment LED) – red or green LED look

Minimal Modern – clean sans-serif, subtle glow

Terminal / Retro – monospace, CRT-style glow

Bold Dashboard – large digits, high contrast

Soft / Ambient – rounded font, low contrast, calm colors

Styles must be switchable via a style prop or config object.

Customization Options

Font size (small / medium / large or px-based)

Primary color

Background (transparent or solid)

Optional seconds display toggle

Optional blinking colon toggle

Technical Constraints

Implement as a single reusable component

No external date/time libraries

Clean separation between logic and presentation

Easy to theme and extend

No global side effects

Output

Component code

Style definitions per variant

Example usage showing switching styles at runtime

Prefer clarity, maintainability, and dashboard-ready aesthetics over novelty.
